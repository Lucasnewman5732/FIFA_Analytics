# FIFA_Analytics
This project will seek to conduct analytics on FIFA datasets to gain insights on what makes elite players, which players should clubs invest in, create a better value model and more.

#Data Bank Creation
For my data bank creation, I wanted to have an exhaustive amount of fifa data so I created a data bank.
These banks are derivative of essentially two Kaggle datasets that I modified for myself.
The links to these kaggle sets are: https://www.kaggle.com/kevinmh/fifa-18-more-complete-player-dataset,  and https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer
